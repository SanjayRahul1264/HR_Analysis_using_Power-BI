# HR Analysis using Power-BI

**OVERVIEW**

Employee attrition, or staff turnover, is a critical challenge for organizations worldwide. High attrition results in increased recruitment costs, productivity loss, and reduced employee morale. To mitigate this, organizations are increasingly turning to data analytics to uncover hidden patterns, identify risk factors, and design effective retention strategies.
This project applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and dashboarding on an HR dataset of 1,470 employees (34 features) to identify key factors driving attrition and to present insights in an interactive dashboard.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Employee attrition (i.e., employees leaving an organization) is one of the biggest challenges faced by HR departments across industries. High attrition rates lead to increased recruitment costs, knowledge loss, and reduced productivity, making it essential for organizations to understand why employees leave and how to retain them.

This project uses the HR Analytics dataset (1,480 employees, 34 features) to:

‚Ä¢	Identify key factors that influence employee attrition, such as age, income, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and career growth.

‚Ä¢	Analyze trends and patterns in employee demographics, compensation, and satisfaction metrics.

‚Ä¢	Build predictive models to estimate the likelihood of attrition and highlight at-risk employees.

‚Ä¢	Provide data-driven insights to help HR managers design better retention strategies, improve employee satisfaction, and reduce turnover.

In short, the goal is to answer: 

‚Äú**What drives employees to leave the company, and how can data-driven strategies help improve retention?**‚Äù


**HR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD ‚Äì EXPLANATION**

The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee demographics, salaries, job roles, and attrition patterns within the organization. It is designed to help HR managers quickly identify trends, risk areas, and actionable insights for improving employee retention.

‚ú® **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

At the top of the dashboard, several high-level metrics summarize the overall workforce status:

‚Ä¢	Total Employees (1,470): The dataset covers 1,470 employees across different departments and job roles.

‚Ä¢	Attrition (237 employees): Out of the total workforce, 237 employees left the organization, highlighting a turnover challenge.

‚Ä¢	Attrition Rate (16.09%): This percentage reflects the overall employee turnover rate, which is a significant figure for HR to monitor.

‚Ä¢	Average Age (37 years): The typical employee is around 37 years old, showing a mid-career workforce.

‚Ä¢	Average Income (6.5K): On average, employees earn 6,500 per month, but distribution analysis shows income disparity among roles.

‚Ä¢	Experience (7 years): Employees typically have 7 years of total working experience.

üìä **Attrition by Education**

This donut chart illustrates how attrition varies across educational backgrounds.

‚Ä¢	The majority of employees leaving belong to Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (27%) fields.

‚Ä¢	Marketing (15%) and Technical degrees (14%) contribute moderately, while other fields account for only 5%.

This indicates that scientific and medical roles experience higher turnover, possibly due to high market demand and more external opportunities for these professionals.


üìä **Attrition by Age**

The bar chart on age distribution reveals that attrition is heavily skewed toward younger employees:

‚Ä¢	The largest group leaving the company falls within the 26‚Äì35 age range (116 employees).

‚Ä¢	Early-career professionals (18‚Äì25 years) also show significant turnover (44 employees).

‚Ä¢	Attrition decreases steadily with age, with very few exits beyond 46 years.
This trend suggests that younger employees are more likely to switch jobs early in their careers, either for better salaries or growth opportunities.

üìä **Top Job Roles**

The horizontal bar chart highlights which job roles face the most attrition:

‚Ä¢	Laboratory Technicians (62) and Sales Executives (57) show the highest turnover.


‚Ä¢	Research Scientists (47) also face significant attrition.

‚Ä¢	Sales Representatives (33) and Human Resources staff (12) follow at lower levels.
This pattern reveals that technical and sales roles are more vulnerable to attrition, likely due to stressful work environments and abundant external opportunities in these fields.

üìä **Salary vs Attrition**

The bar chart on salary slabs clearly shows the financial aspect of turnover:

‚Ä¢	The overwhelming majority of attrition (163 employees) occurs among those earning up to 5K per month.

‚Ä¢	Attrition decreases sharply as salaries increase: 49 in the 5K‚Äì10K range, 20 in the 10K‚Äì15K range, and only 5 employees above 15K.
This strongly indicates that salary dissatisfaction is one of the most critical drivers of attrition.

üìä **Years in Company**

The line chart illustrates how long employees stay before leaving:

‚Ä¢	Attrition peaks around 2 years of tenure, where 59 employees exit.

‚Ä¢	A sharp decline follows, with smaller peaks around 4 and 10 years.
This shows that employees are most likely to leave within the first few years of joining, often due to unmet career expectations or lack of growth.

üìä **Job Role vs Attrition Level**

The matrix table in the dashboard shows attrition broken down by job role and satisfaction/performance levels. For example:

‚Ä¢	Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives are the most affected groups, with attrition spread across multiple levels of involvement and satisfaction.

‚Ä¢	Specialized roles like Research Directors and Managers have very low attrition, suggesting higher stability at senior levels.
This table provides HR with role-specific details to identify which positions need urgent retention strategies.
 
**‚úÖ CONCLUSION**

The HR Analytics Dashboard paints a clear picture:

‚Ä¢	The company has an overall attrition rate of 16.09%, which is significantly influenced by salary, job role, and tenure.

‚Ä¢	Younger employees (26‚Äì35 years), particularly in technical and sales roles, are at the highest risk of leaving.

‚Ä¢	Salary dissatisfaction is the strongest predictor, with over 68% of attrition coming from employees earning below 5K.

‚Ä¢	Employees are most likely to leave within the first 2 years, highlighting the need for early engagement and career development strategies.

**Final Insight:** By improving compensation structures for entry-level employees, offering better growth opportunities, and addressing job satisfaction factors in technical and sales roles, HR can significantly reduce turnover and improve overall workforce stability.
